# Three Things From Lecture that are used for my Low-Fidelity Prototype

1. Signifiers :- For signifiers, I used search button and every SDG logo. These type of things a normal person relate to can understand.

2. Constraints :- Semantic Constraints for my lofi reduces through Slide Bars and Arrow annontations where normal person using web     browser know how to scroll things and how much to scroll so he/she gets the view that user wants to see.4

3. Declarative Knowledge and Procedural Knowledge :- In some cases users do not find any kind of direct declaration to use the product. For example, For a preview if users do not find any quote or text which should map how this/that button will provide more details on that, users might never know about details feature. So I added some text or something to direct user to do some procedure in order to get that feature.
