## Problem description 


### We have been tasks to create a website that can provide local data and SDG mapping for Regina. Primarily this information will be targeted towards "decision makers", and professionals who can actively use the data provided to elicit change in our community. Secondarily there will be information and context for the general public on SDG data and how Regina as a community is achieving those goals, will also provide volunteer and community resources.
