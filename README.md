# ENSE-271--Group-B

## Problem description 


### We have been tasked to create a website that can provide local data and SDG mapping for Regina. Primarily, this information will be targeted towards "decision makers", and professionals who can actively use the data provided to elicit change in our community. Secondarily, there will be detailed information for the general public on SDG data and how Regina as a community is achieving those goals. Also, we hope to provide volunteer and community resources.
